- User Management: Admins need to be able to oversee user accounts, handle sign-ups, manage user roles, and address any account-related issues.
- Content Moderation: The admin panel should provide tools for monitoring and regulating the content being posted. This could include options for approving posts, banning users, or flagging content.
- Analytics Dashboard: A built-in analytics dashboard to provide insights on site traffic, user engagement, and content performance. This will be crucial for understanding the site's growth and areas for improvement.

In addition to the admin panel, there is some additional work needed to improve the messaging system, a credits/finances system, and login/signup. These parts are largely finished, but need a bit more done with them.

-This is the image for the login/signup. This for the whole background. Login/signup fields, and the footer with the policies.

Use this as a loading screen. Whenever a page is loading, display this across the whole screen. I am not sure if that is already done or not.

Please try to make at least one commit per day

So I can track your progress

I remembered one other change. I am not sure if this is already done, but on light mode, the background should not be white. Instead of white it should be the light color there. #fff9f6

-Modify - Background change
modify \src\components\home\auth-screen\HeroSection.tsx 
modify \src\app\layout.tsx

I modified login/signup page as this image. Is this what you need?
