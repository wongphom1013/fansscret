                Web3 Services, LLC ("we", "us", "our") respects your privacy and we are committed to protecting the Personal Data we process about you. Web3 Services, LLC is the owner and operator of www.FansSecret.com ("FansSecret"), a social network and content sharing platform which enables: (i) "Creators" to share and monetize their own content (as well as subscribe to, and view, the content of other Creators); and (ii) "Fans" to subscribe to, and view, the content of Creators.
                This privacy policy ("Policy") explains our practices with respect to the Personal Data processed about our Creators and Fans.
                We process your Personal Data when you use FansSecret and for the provision of the services that we offer from time to time via FansSecret (the "Services"). We are a "data controller" of the Personal Data that we process in connection with the Services. This means that we decide the reasons why we process Personal Data about you and how we do so.

            <p className="font-semibold tracking-tight text-2xl" style={{ fontSize: "18px", fontWeight: "normal" }}>o	Performance of a contract: By using the Services, you have contracted with us through our Terms of Service, and we will process Personal Data to perform that contract (e.g. to fulfil transactions between Fans and Creators and process Creator earnings) and to enforce the terms of that contract. Our terms of service include the Content Security Policy. In order to enforce the Content Security Policy, we must verify the identities and basic financial capacity of users. (We cannot allow people in jurisdictions that do not enforce our terms of service or who do not have the financial capacity to pay for the harm they cause to view content and potentially leak content outside the platform.)</p>

This may include, for example, investigating and responding to a report made through our DMCA takedown procedure, to protect a Creator's intellectual property rights. It may also include the enforcement of our Content Security Policy. </p>
            <p className="font-semibold tracking-tight text-2xl" style={{ fontSize: "18px", fontWeight: "normal" }}>o	Compliance with legal obligations: We may process Personal Data to comply with applicable law, rules and regulations in the locations where we operate (e.g. complying with financial / tax reporting requirements). </p>
            <p className="font-semibold tracking-tight text-2xl" style={{ fontSize: "18px", fontWeight: "normal" }}>o	Task carried out in the public interest: We may process Personal Data as necessary for a task carried out in the public interest. This may include, for example, reporting illegal activity to relevant law enforcement authorities, other governmental authorities and non-governmental organizations. </p>
            <p className="font-semibold tracking-tight text-2xl" style={{ fontSize: "18px", fontWeight: "normal" }}>We will only use your Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. </p>
