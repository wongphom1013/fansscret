     <h1>UK VAT POLICY</h1>

<h2>UK VAT and Creators Based in the UK</h2>
<p>For UK VAT purposes, Creators are considered to be providing services to FansSecret, not directly to Fans.</p>

<h2>Creators Registered for UK VAT</h2>
<p>If you are a Creator registered for UK VAT:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For VAT purposes, you will be regarded as charging FansSecret for your Creator Earnings (80% of any and all Fan Payments), plus the UK VAT at the current rate applicable at the time of the Fan Payment.</li>
  <li>FansSecret agrees that, in line with the Terms of Service, any payments you receive under the Referral Program will be considered VAT-inclusive.</li>
  <li>The VAT portion added to your Creator Earnings (and any Referral Payments) (referred to as the "VAT Amount") will be paid separately from your standard Creator Earnings, provided you have first:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Submitted your VAT registration number via this form: <a href="#">VAT Registration Form</a>;</li>
    <li>Generated and provided a VAT invoice using the FansSecret VAT invoice tool: <a href="#">VAT Invoice Generator</a>;</li>
    <li>Submitted a VAT return to HM Revenue & Customs for the relevant period.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p>You can review your monthly earnings here: <a href="#">Earnings Details</a>.</p>
<p>You are responsible for paying the VAT Amount directly to HM Revenue & Customs.</p>

<h2>Further Assistance and Compliance</h2>
<p>For more details on receiving the VAT Amount, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Email <a href="mailto:vat@FansSecret.com">vat@FansSecret.com</a>;</li>
  <li>Refer to our <a href="#">Community Guidelines</a>;</li>
  <li>Review the <a href="#">HMRC guidance on VAT registration</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must provide copies of all VAT invoices and VAT returns related to your Creator Earnings (and Referral Payments, if applicable) upon request. It is solely your responsibility to ensure VAT compliance.</p>
