      <h1>DMCA TAKEDOWN POLICY</h1>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This DMCA Takedown Policy is solely for reporting infringing content on
        FansSecret.com. If you need help removing infringing material from other
        websites, please contact us separately.
      </p>

      <h2>DMCA Notice & Takedown Policy and Procedures</h2>
      <p>
        We respect copyright holders' intellectual property rights and
        voluntarily comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)
        notice and takedown provisions. As a "Service Provider" under 17 U.S.C.
        § 512(k)(1) of the DMCA, we qualify for "safe harbor" protections from
        copyright infringement claims. We expect our users to respect
        intellectual property rights as well. This Notice and Takedown Policy
        governs how we handle copyright infringement claims involving content on
        our platform.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Submit a Notice of Claimed Infringement</h2>
      <p>
        If you believe your copyrighted work has been published on
        FansSecret.com without authorization, please submit a notice to our
        Designated Copyright Agent with the following information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your electronic or physical signature, as the owner or authorized
          representative of the copyright holder.
        </li>
        <li>
          A description of the copyrighted work or intellectual property that
          you claim has been infringed.
        </li>
        <li>
          A description of the location of the infringing material on
          FansSecret.com (including specific URLs, if possible).
        </li>
        <li>Your contact information (address, phone number, and email).</li>
        <li>
          A statement of your good faith belief that the use of the material is
          not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
        </li>
        <li>
          A declaration, made under penalty of perjury, that the information you
          provided is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or
          authorized to act on the owner's behalf.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Submit your Notice to:{" "}
        <strong>[NOTICE PERSON] Designated Copyright Agent</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: This policy applies only to infringing content on FansSecret.com.
        Our Designated Agent is not authorized to accept or waive service of
        formal legal processes without prior permission.

      <h2>Abuse Notification</h2>
      <p>
        Filing false DMCA notices or misrepresenting facts in a DMCA notice or
        counter-notification can lead to legal liability, including damages,
        court costs, and attorneys' fees under 17 U.S.C. § 512(f). These
        procedures apply only to copyright infringement claims—not to other
        legal issues or claims. We will investigate and take appropriate action
        against anyone abusing the DMCA process.
      </p>

      <h2>Takedown Procedure</h2>
      <p>
        Upon receiving a valid DMCA notice, we will disable access to or remove
        the infringing material. If the notice is not fully compliant with DMCA
        requirements but meets certain minimum standards, we will attempt to
        contact the party to help them meet the necessary requirements. When a
        valid notice is received, we will notify the affected user and give them
        the opportunity to submit a counter-notification. Repeat copyright
        infringers may have their accounts terminated.
      </p>

      <h2>DMCA Counter-Notification Procedure</h2>
      <p>
        If you believe that a notice of claimed infringement was erroneous or
        that your material was wrongly removed, you may submit a
        counter-notification under Section 512(g)(2) & (3) of the DMCA. The
        counter-notification must include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A specific description of the material that was removed or disabled.
        </li>
        <li>
          A description of where the material appeared on the site before
          removal (including URLs if possible).
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement that you have a good faith belief that the removal or
          disabling of the material was a mistake or misidentification.
        </li>
        <li>Your contact information (address, phone number, and email).</li>
        <li>
          A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal
          District Court in your location or in the service provider's
          jurisdiction, and that you will accept service of process from the
          original claimant.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Submit your counter-notification to:{" "}
        <strong>[NOTICE PERSON] Designated Copyright Agent</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        All notices and counter-notifications must be in English. Non-compliant
        notices will be disregarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        After receiving a valid counter-notification, we will forward it to the
        original claimant and restore the content within 10-14 days unless we
        are informed that the claimant has filed a court action seeking an
        injunction.
      </p>

      <h2>Modifications to the Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may modify or update this policy at any time. Users should check back
        regularly to stay informed of any changes.
      </p>

      <h2>Customer Service Requests</h2>
      <p>

        associated with FansSecret in any other capacity. For customer service,
        payment issues, or cancellation requests, please contact the site's
