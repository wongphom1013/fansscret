      <h1>2257 Disclosure Statement – FansSecret</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        While FansSecret does not produce or post any content, we comply with
        the requirements of 18 U.S.C. §§2257, 2257A, and 28 C.F.R. §75 ("Section
        2257").
      </p>
      <p>
        FansSecret is a secondary producer as defined in 28 C.F.R. §75.1(c)(2)
        and therefore under 28 C.F.R. §75.2(b), FansSecret must maintain
        detailed records of identifications of all people appearing in content
        for age verification and identification purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>Relevant Regulation</h2>
      <p>
        Please see <strong>28 C.F.R. §75.2(b):</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        “(b) A producer who is a secondary producer as defined in §75.1(c) may
        satisfy the requirements of this part to create and maintain records by
        accepting from the primary producer, as defined in §75.1(c), copies of
        the records described in paragraph (a) of this section. Such a secondary
        producer shall also keep records of the name and address of the primary
        producer from whom he received copies of the records. The copies of the
        records may be redacted to eliminate non-essential information,
        including addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, and other
        information not necessary to confirm the name and age of the performer.
        However, the identification number of the picture identification card
        presented to confirm the name and age may not be redacted.”
