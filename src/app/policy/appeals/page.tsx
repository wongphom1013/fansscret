        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Appeal a Decision</h2>
      <p>
        To appeal a Decision, you must submit a completed Deactivation Appeal
        Form.
      </p>

      <h3>Required Information</h3>
      <p>
        Only fully completed Deactivation Appeal Forms will be considered. Your
        form must include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The account username or URL;</li>
        <li>The URL of the Content being appealed;</li>
        <li>
          Detailed reasons why you believe the Content or account complies with
          our Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policy;
        </li>
        <li>
          For non-FansSecret users in the EU/EEA, an explanation of why the
          Content is illegal or non-consensual.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Appeal Timeframe</h3>
      <p>Appeals should be submitted within six months of the Decision.</p>

      <h2>Review Process</h2>
      <p>Once we receive a completed Deactivation Appeal Form:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>We will review the relevant account information;</li>
        <li>We will consider the information and documents you provide;</li>
        <li>
          We may request additional information from you or third parties as
          needed;
        </li>
        <li>
          Based on the review, we will either fully grant, partially grant, or
          deny your appeal, and we will notify you of our decision:
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If granted, all relevant Decisions and actions taken as a result
            will be reversed.
          </li>
          <li>
            If granted in part, we will specify which Decisions have been
            reversed and the actions taken.
          </li>
          <li>If denied, no changes will be made to the original Decision.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>No Liability:</strong> We are not responsible for any
        interruption to your FansSecret account, including loss of earnings or
        subscribers, even if we grant your appeal.
      </p>

      <h2>Appeals Team</h2>
      <p>
        Our Appeals Team reviews each properly filed appeal in a
        non-discriminatory, diligent, and impartial manner.
      </p>

      <h2>Non-Appealable Decisions</h2>
      <p>
        This Policy does not apply to irreversible Decisions (e.g., ending a
        livestream).
      </p>

      <h2>Additional Procedures for EU/EEA Users</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You may file a complaint with a regulatory authority, pursue a remedy
          through a certified third-party dispute settlement body, or take legal
          action in the courts of your country of residence or establishment.
        </li>
        <li>
          In certain cases, disputes may be settled under the EU Digital
          Services Act (DSA) via an out-of-court dispute resolution body
          certified by each EU member state.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may also seek judicial redress through the appropriate court.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may report or file a complaint regarding Content you believe to be
          illegal or in violation of our Terms of Service. We will review such
          reports and make a decision.
        </li>
        <li>
          If we find no violation of our Terms of Service and choose not to take
          action, you may refer the issue to an out-of-court dispute body. We
          will engage with such a body in good faith, as required by law.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> We are not obligated to follow the decisions of
        an out-of-court dispute resolution body and may decline to engage if a
        previous dispute regarding the same Content and the same grounds has
        already been resolved.
